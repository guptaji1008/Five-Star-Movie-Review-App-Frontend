# 5 Star MRP  - Movie Review App

This is a simple Movie review app where you can rate and comment on the Movie by watching trailer. This project is a full MERN stack project. 


## Introduction

Basically, I was searching a project where I can furnish my MERN (Mongodb, Express, React, Node) knowledge and I got a project on udemy where the project was on making a movie review app using MERN. This is my first full stack project where I have learnt many things and lots of thing which I usually think that how this things are made when I watch any other application like creating a proper login, signup and authentications, liveSearch with recommendations, slider shows and many more. My real aim was to learn that how big projects are made, how to manage files, how to "NOT REPEAT YOURSELF" in programming and lastly to gain some experience. 


## Technologies

1. axios 1.5.1
2. react 18.2.0,
3. react-drag-drop-files 2.3.10
4. react-icons 4.11.0
5. react-router-dom 6.16.0
6. react-toastify 9.1.3


## Project Status

The application is almost ready to use. There are some some correction that is still required, but that will not effect the user experience. Basically Iam working on how to better user experience, although basic structure of the application is ready. 


## IMPORTANT

Since I have added a functionality of email verification where after signup, there ia a process of you email verification. The only problem is that I have used "Mail-Trap" website for my OTP verification or any other thing ie done through email, will be recieved on Mail-Trap. I have not used original email sending because every website requires my own server and domain which currently Iam unable to buy because of it is costing me too much. 
It is my humble request to all the users that if you want to take a look up in the application, then please use the following email-Id and password and please don't test forgot password because for that also link for reseting password will go to the Mail-Trap.
